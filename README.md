Panda3D and bullet example.
I didn't use panda bullet integration because it is not as flexible as pybullet and got lot of issues with it.

So I have a separate thread running pybullet.
Panda3D does the visualisation by fetching pybullet data.

This example uses tracker vive 3.0 but should work with any other tracker.
